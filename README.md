 # TreeToFS (Tree to File System)

**TreeToFS** is a set of cross-platform scripts designed to convert a text-based tree representation (commonly generated by the `tree` command) back into a physical directory and file structure.

Whether you are restoring a project structure from documentation or quickly scaffolding a new project based on a visual layout, these scripts automate the creation of folders and empty files across **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

## 🚀 Features

* **Dynamic indentation detection**: Automatically detects the size of indentation used in your text file.
* **Automatic cleaning**: Strips common `tree` output symbols like `│`, `├`, `└`, and trailing indicators like `/`, `*`, or `@`.
* **Hierarchy reconstruction**: Tracks the parent-child relationship to ensure deep nested structures are created accurately.
* **Cross-platform**: Includes dedicated scripts for PowerShell, Windows Batch, and Bash.

## 🛠️ Usage

All scripts require an **input file** containing the text representation of your directory tree. You can optionally provide a **destination path** (defaults to the current directory).

### 1. PowerShell (`.ps1`)

```powershell
.\TreeToFileSystem.ps1 -File "structure.txt" -Destination "./Output"
```

### 2. Windows Batch (`.bat`)

```batch
tree-to-file-system.bat structure.txt ./Output
```

### 3. Bash (`.sh`)

```bash
chmod +x tree-to-file-system.sh
./tree-to-file-system.sh structure.txt ./Output
```

## 📝 Input format example

The scripts are designed to parse standard `tree` command outputs. An input file (e.g., `structure.txt`) should look like this:

```text
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils.py
├── docs/
│   └── README.md
└── config.yaml

```

* **Directories**: Identified by a trailing `/` or having children.
* **Files**: Created as empty files if no trailing slash is present.
* **Footers**: The scripts automatically ignore "directories/files" summary lines usually found at the end of `tree` outputs.
